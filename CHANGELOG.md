# Changelog

All notable hardening rounds for this project. Each round corresponds to a
plan document under `.local/planning/v{N}/` (older plans were tracked at
`docs/integration-hardening-plan-v{N}.md` before v18; the docs/* path is
now gitignored so plan drafts stay local).

## v22 — HTML renderer + worked rendering examples

Completes the deliverable-rendering trio (markdown / DOCX / HTML)
started in v21. Browser-viewable HTML is the natural third format
when a user wants to share an answer via email or intranet without
attaching a Word file.

- `scripts/render-html.py` — vendored verbatim from
  `legal-research-agent` (87 lines, no DPA-domain rewrites needed —
  the renderer is generic). Uses `marko` for markdown→HTML, wraps
  in a self-contained styled HTML document with inline CSS
  (max-width 760px, bordered tables, code-block styling).
- `requirements.txt` adds `marko>=2.0.0`.
- `.claude/commands/answer.md` accepts `--html` flag (independent
  of `--docx`; both may be combined).
- `tests/test_e2e_agent_pipeline.py` adds `test_packet_renders_html`
  parametrised over all 5 fixtures (asserts HTML > 2 KB + DOCTYPE
  present + `<title>` tag). Test skips gracefully when `marko` is
  unavailable.
- `docs/rendering-examples.md` (new) — worked example walking
  through all 4 output forms (md / meta.json / docx / html) for
  the same 3-jurisdiction ADM analysis used in the v21 dogfood.
  Includes file sizes, structure introspection, when-to-use table.

Test counts:
  - Before: CA 49 / KR 23 / EU 28 / cross 129 = 229
  - After:  CA 49 / KR 23 / EU 28 / cross 134 = 234 (+5 v22 HTML)

## v21 — DOCX + legal-opinion output (vendored from legal-research-agent)

Adds the second axis to the output contract: `output_mode` is now orthogonal
to `research_mode`. The default `canonical` (the 9-section research memo
shipped in v19) is preserved for backward compatibility; `legal_opinion`
adds a polished DOCX deliverable suitable for client circulation.

Rather than reinventing rendering and formatting infrastructure, v21
vendors the proven assets from the sibling `legal-research-agent`:

- `scripts/render-docx.py` — basic markdown→DOCX renderer (KO/EN page
  setups, Times New Roman + 맑은 고딕 fallback, source-table styling).
- `scripts/render-legal-opinion-docx.py` — polished legal-opinion
  renderer with cover page (title, recipient, date, classification
  banner), auto-numbered headings, indented italic statutory excerpts,
  endnote-style 각주 section, page-numbered footer with confidentiality
  classification on every page.
- `knowledge/legal-writing/` — 5 formatter profiles (`en-formatter-profile`,
  `ko-formatter-profile`, `ko-legal-opinion-profile`,
  `docx-ready-markdown-profile`, `formatter-index`) covering tone,
  heading hierarchy, citation style, and per-language typography defaults.
- `.claude/skills/legal-writing-formatter/` — composition skill for the
  polished deliverable.
- `.claude/skills/output-mode-composition/` — output_mode dispatcher skill.
- `templates/modes/{black-letter-commentary,comparative-matrix,
  enforcement-case-law,executive-brief}.md` — 4 additional output_mode
  templates (the existing single-jurisdiction / multi-jurisdiction /
  comparative-matrix / fallback templates remain).

DPA-domain patches applied to vendored files:

- All `legal-research-agent-result.md` / `legal-research-agent-meta.json`
  references rewritten to `data-protection-agent-result.md` /
  `data-protection-agent-meta.json`.
- `Legal Research Agent (legal-research-agent)` author default rewritten
  to `Data Protection Agent (data-protection-agent)`.
- Backtick references to ``legal-research-agent`` rewritten to
  ``data-protection-agent``.

Meta schema (additive, all optional):

- `output_mode` — one of `canonical | legal_opinion | executive_brief |
  comparative_matrix | enforcement_case_law | black_letter_commentary`;
  default `canonical`.
- `output_mode_audience` — free-text audience descriptor; default `null`.
- `output_mode_format` — `markdown | docx_ready_markdown`; default
  `markdown`.

Validator:

- New `validate_output_mode_fields()` checks the three new fields against
  `VALID_OUTPUT_MODES` / `VALID_OUTPUT_FORMATS`.
- Existing v19 metadata without the new fields validates unchanged
  (treated as implicit canonical defaults).

`/answer` command:

- Accepts `output_mode=legal_opinion` and `--docx` arguments.
- Auto-renders DOCX when `output_mode=legal_opinion`.
- Default Korean opinion-letter cover-page values (수신인, 기밀 분류,
  날짜) are applied unless the user overrides.

`requirements.txt` (new): pins `python-docx>=1.1.0` and `pytest>=7.0`.

## v20 — Retrieval quality + auditor false-positive cleanup (`fcda737..6ad4879`)

Two related rounds driven by the v19 dogfood:

- **v20-mini (false-positive cleanup):** `fallback_us` was treated as
  non-fallback by the validator, producing spurious missing-namespaces /
  empty-sources errors. `local_id_citations()` matched authority-id-shaped
  tokens inside backtick-wrapped paths and prose hyphenations
  (`US-California`), spamming "Local KB id is not present in any index"
  warnings. Cross-jurisdiction labels check fired on fallback memos that
  legitimately mention multiple jurisdictions only to explain they are
  out of scope. All three fixed: `FALLBACK_MODES` set, `_strip_inline_code()`
  helper + lowercase-only id matching + namespace token exclusion (CA/KR/EU),
  and a `Research mode: fallback*` preflight that skips the labels check.
- **v20-retrieval:** Only CA had a topic index, so KR/EU retrieval fell
  back to keyword scoring and surfaced wrong-but-valid authorities
  (data-act-art33 instead of gdpr-art33; pipa-art28-6 instead of
  pipa-art34). Added `kb/kr-pipa/index/kr-topic-index.json` and
  `kb/eu-gdpr/index/eu-topic-index.json` (8 curated topics each — breach
  notification, lawful basis / consent, data-subject rights, sensitive
  data, cross-border transfer, DPIA, ADM, enforcement). Patched
  `import_namespaced_kbs.py` to read per-namespace topic files; patched
  `phrase_in()` to treat space and hyphen as interchangeable separators
  (so `breach notification` matches `breach-notification`); expanded the
  CA primary-law boost beyond ca-ccpa-* to include ca-customer-records,
  ca-caloppa, ca-cipa, ca-cmia, ca-data-broker-delete-act, and
  ca-age-appropriate-design-code. Bonus: added 11 CCR § 7070/7071 to the
  CA `minors_children` topic (golden regression fix).

After v20, T2.1 dogfood (3-way breach-notification) surfaces gdpr-art33,
pipa-art34 + decree art39/40, civ-1798.150 + civ-1798.82 in top-K.

## v19 — Agent answering pipeline (`67b446e..04b1ca5`, planned in `.local/planning/v19/`)

Adds the LLM-facing answering layer on top of the v3-v18 KB and auditor
stack. Five Codex-implemented commits behind a single plan:

- 7 new skills under `.claude/skills/` (intake-and-routing, kb-retrieval,
  trust-boundary, claim-grounding, result-memo-composition,
  comparative-composition, quality-check) — each with
  `disable-model-invocation: true` so the LLM loads them only when
  explicitly told to via `CLAUDE.md` references.
- 6 templates under `templates/` (canonical 9-section result.md +
  meta.example.json + per-mode variants for single-jurisdiction,
  multi-jurisdiction, comparative-matrix, fallback).
- New `scripts/validate-output.py` (538 lines, stdlib only) — dual-mode:
  full v19 strict checks AND legacy_packet compatibility for the
  pre-v19 deterministic runner.
- `/answer` slash command + refreshed `.claude/agents/data-protection-agent.md`
  + `CLAUDE.md` §9 workflow section.
- 5 golden fixtures (`g_ca_001`, `g_kr_001`, `g_eu_001`, `g_multi_001`,
  `g_comp_001`) + parametrised e2e tests covering validator and auditor.

Mirrors `legal-research-agent`'s 8-stage workflow (intake → retrieval →
trust-boundary → claim-grounding → composition → quality-check → write).

## v18 — Quote integrity check (`fbf45c9..05a911c`)

LLM hallucination most commonly takes the form of a correct citation id
paired with a fabricated quote — citation-id checks alone don't catch
this. Adds `check_quote_integrity()` to all three sub-auditors. Pulls
the cited authority's body via `load_authority_body()`, normalises both
the body and the quoted text, and verifies via substring match plus a
token-overlap fallback (>=80% of >=3-letter tokens within a 1.5x window).
KR variant uses substring only (Hangul has no whitespace word
boundaries). +12 tests (CA 49, KR 23, EU 28).

## v17 — KR/EU future-effective check (`02e4f44..633ba93`)

Mirrors v11's CA future-effective check for KR and EU. Both KBs use
YYYYMMDD-format effective_date in their article indexes. KR uses
bilingual present-tense triggers (English `currently`/`requires` plus
Korean `현재`/`지금`/`시행 중`/`반드시`/`해야 한다`); EU uses English-only.
Today (2026-05-07) has 0 future-effective articles in either KB; the
mechanism is forward-looking. +6 tests.

## v16 — Worked-examples cookbook (`e90a627`)

`docs/examples.md` (245 lines) — 7 worked auditor examples with real
inputs and the actual JSON output the unified auditor produces, covering
each of the major check categories. Useful for onboarding new
contributors and for explaining auditor behaviour to non-implementer
users.

## v15 — CI for schema validation + kb-diff + coverage reports (`6db152d`)

Wires the v13-v14 schema validator, KB snapshot diff, and coverage
reports into the GitHub Actions CI as separate steps so each gets its
own pass/fail signal in the PR check log. Graceful skip when KR/EU
sibling repos are unavailable on the CI runner.

## v14 — KB snapshot diff CLI (`905e15c`)

`scripts/kb-diff.py` — set-diff between two snapshots of the unified
authority index, with per-namespace breakdowns. Surfaces additions,
removals, and id renames between any two commits. Used in CI to
flag unexpected churn.

## v13 — KB schema validation + reverse lookup tools (`966f37e..7d5a73a..16c7ca3..8e1d175..9745fcf`)

Five small tools rounded into one round:

- `scripts/validate-kb-schema.py` — checks 14 indexes (2,414 items
  total) against required-field expectations.
- `scripts/who-is.py` — pretty-prints all metadata for a single
  authority id, parsing markdown frontmatter directly.
- `scripts/who-cites.py` — reverse citation lookup ("which authorities
  reference X?").
- `scripts/coverage-report-all.py` — unified CA+KR+EU coverage dashboard.
- `tests/test_e2e_unified_auditor.py` — integration test piping a
  curated multi-juris answer through the full auditor stack.

## v12 — KR/EU coverage reports + CHANGELOG

- KR PIPA coverage report (`scripts/coverage-report-kr.py`) using
  cross-reference-graph (1,309 edges from 428 unique articles) and
  external-law-candidates (154 entries).
- EU GDPR coverage report (`scripts/coverage-report-eu.py`) using
  case-index + edpb-document-index `gdpr_articles` references; 62.6%
  GDPR coverage (62 of 99 articles cited).
- This CHANGELOG.

## v11 — Future-effective + pre-commit + CA coverage report (`a909f51..f2b68cc`)

- CA `check_future_effective_cited_as_current` (warn when authority with
  future `effective_date` is cited with present-tense language). Today
  (2026-05-07) has 0 future-effective authorities; check is forward-looking.
- Opt-in pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`) running unified auditor
  on staged .md files (skips meta-docs to avoid false positives).
- CA authority coverage report (`scripts/coverage-report.py`) — first
  measurement: 40.5% coverage (94 of 232) across 5 families. Strongest:
  case (89.7%); weakest: statute (21.7%), adjacent_statute (31%).

## v10 — README + auditors catalog + CI (`fd6c68d..a909f51`)

- README.md expanded from 57 → 183 lines with sub-KB table, architecture
  ASCII tree, test coverage breakdown.
- `docs/auditors.md` — consolidated catalog of ~27 checks across 4 layers.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — push/PR CI: Python 3.12, KB build,
  per-sub-KB tests with KR/EU graceful skip on CI runners (no sibling
  repos available).

## v9 — Unified auditor + STRICT labels + vocab+vague (`4e6b33b..fd6c68d`)

- `unified_auditor/run.py` — single-call runner over all 4 auditors via
  importlib (avoids package-name collision). SKILL.md simplified from
  7-step → 5-step.
- `STRICT_JURISDICTION_LABELS` env toggle — strict mode requires every
  signalled jurisdiction to have an explicit label.
- 4 vocab terms (right to object/opt-out, 위탁, joint controllers).
- 3 vague patterns (depending on jurisdiction, in certain cases, may apply).

## v8 — Jurisdiction labels + vocab + vague refs (`08216bb..4e6b33b`)

- `check_jurisdiction_labels` — multi-juris answer with no labels → warn.
- Vocab expansion: right to erasure / be forgotten / access / delete /
  know / DPO / 수탁자.
- 4 vague law reference patterns with proximity-aware skip (±200 chars).

## v7 — Cross-jurisdiction auditor (`add1d97..08216bb`)

- New `cross_jurisdiction_auditor/` package above the 3 sub-auditors.
- `check_citation_routing` — authority cited from non-signalled jurisdiction.
- `check_vocabulary` — jurisdiction-specific terms in wrong context (10
  initial terms across GDPR/CCPA/PIPA).
- ASCII-letter boundary `(?<![A-Za-z])` for vocab regex (Python `\b` fails
  in Korean+English mixed contexts).

## v6 — EDPB binding + KR 시행규칙 + external laws (`1078c96..add1d97`)

- EU `check_edpb_doc_as_binding` — non-binding EDPB doc cited with
  binding language (only `Binding Decision` exempt by `a-binding-` prefix).
- KR 시행규칙 (network-act-enforcement-rule) pattern.
- KR external-law-candidates info-warn for 154 external Korean laws.

## v5 — EU case-law + KR/EU sanitize (`d3cc1b0..1078c96`)

- EU case_number / ECLI / EDPB document_number lookup-based matching
  (51 cases, 535 recitals, 120 EDPB docs).
- KR sub-KB sanitize.py (mirror CA pattern, 13 patterns).
- EU sub-KB sanitize.py.

## v4 — KR + EU sub-auditors (`f50b938..29dafbd`)

- KR PIPA sub-auditor with article + guideline + PIPC-as-binding checks.
- EU GDPR sub-auditor with article + recital + recital-as-binding.
- Wire up SKILL.md.

## v3 — Integration hardening (`b919b31..add1d97 + earlier rounds`)

- `cross_jurisdiction_auditor/` skeleton.
- `unified_auditor/` skeleton.
- README + AGENTS.md.

## Earlier (CA-only construction)

See `docs/california-local-kb-implementation.md` and
`docs/california-local-kb-hardening-plan.md` for the original CA-only
build (CCPA + adjacent statutes + cases) and the hardening plan that
introduced the unified-KB pattern.
